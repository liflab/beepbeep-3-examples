/**
 * Computes the sum of a sliding window of successive Fibonacci numbers.
 * The goal of this program is to compare its performance with that of a
 * similar one called {@link WindowSequential}. Both perform the same
 * computation. However, in the present program, the computation of the window
 * processor is done *sequentially*. That is, upon receiving an event,
 * the window processor pushes it to each window one after the other in the
 * current thread.
 * The output of the processor chain is not printed anywhere; rather, the
 * program simply counts the *time* taken to process the inputs.
 * 
 * On a machine with multiple cores, this program should run slower than
 * {@link WindowParallel} for the same values of
 * {@link WindowParallel#WIDTH WIDTH} and
 * {@link WindowParallel#NUM_WINDOWS NUM_WINDOWS}. Note that the performance
 * gain may become apparent only for large values of these two parameters.
 * For a small number of small windows, the overhead of using multiple threads
 * offsets the potential performance gains offered by concurrency.
 * 
 * @see WindowParallel
