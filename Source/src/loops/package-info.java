/**
 * Examples of processor chains involving loops, i.e.<!-- --> paths in the
 * graph where the output of a processor ultimately leads back to one of its
 * own inputs.
 * <p>
 * Although loops in processor chains are not explicitly forbidden, they are
 * seldom required in "normal" operations and should be used with extreme care.
 * Connecting the output of a processor directly to its input will very likely
 * result in a {@link StackOverflowError} except in special cases.
 * <p>
 * Nevertheless, there exist situations where such loops are justified and for
 * which BeepBeep's behavior is well defined. This typically occurs when the
 * output of a processor is delayed "forward" in time before going back to its
 * input, for example by the use of an {@link Insert} processor. The examples
 * in this package show some of these situations.
