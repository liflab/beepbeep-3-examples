/**
 * Displays the trail of the mouse pointer inside a heat map. The program
 * creates two windows: the first is the "mouse playground", which is a small
 * empty frame where the mouse movements are recorded; the second is a
 * window that displays a "heat map", which is a two-dimensional plot made
 * of rectangular cells, where the color of each cell is associated to a
 * numerical value. In the present case, each cell represents a rectangular
 * zone of pixels in the mouse playground, and the numerical value for each
 * zone is the total number of mouse events that occurred in that zone.
 * The end result looks like the following screenshot:
 * <p>
 * <img src="{@docRoot}/doc-files/plots/heatmap.png" alt="Screenshot" />
 * <p>
 * One can see the heatmap update as the user moves the mouse in the
 * playground. Colors that tend towards blue indicate that the mouse has not
 * spent a lot of time in that zone, while red and yellow colors indicate
 * the mouse has spent more time. The plot only updates when the mouse moves.
