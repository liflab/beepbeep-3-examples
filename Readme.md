Code examples for BeepBeep 3
============================

This repository contains a large number of simple coding examples illustrating
the use of the BeepBeep 3 event stream processor and the various palettes that
come with it. All the code examples are heavily documented, with line-by-line
explanations of what is being done.

What you need
-------------

- Java 6 or more recent
- The most recent release of [BeepBeep 3](https://github.com/liflab/beepbeep-3)
- The most recent releases of all the palettes found in the
  [palettes repository](https://github.com/liflab/beepbeep-3-palettes) and
  their dependencies
- Optionally, an IDE such as Eclipse or NetBeans to read and run the code
  examples

Organization of this repository
-------------------------------

- All code is in the `Source/src` folder. If you want to look at the examples
  inside an IDE, you can create a Java project with `Source` as the root
  folder.
- Each subfolder corresponds to a Java package. Each package contains examples
  centered on a particular theme. For example, the `http` folder shows how to
  use network connections.
- Read the Javadoc comments in `package-info.java` in each subfolder for a
  description of that particular set of files.
- Read the Javadoc comments in each file for specific details.
