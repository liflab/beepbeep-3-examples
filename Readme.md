Code examples for BeepBeep 3
============================

This repository contains a large number of simple coding examples illustrating
the use of the BeepBeep 3 event stream processor and the various palettes that
come with it. All the code examples are heavily documented, with line-by-line
explanations of what is being done.

What you need
-------------

- Java 6 or more recent
- The most recent release of [BeepBeep 3](https://github.com/liflab/beepbeep-3)
- The most recent releases of all the palettes found in the
  [palettes repository](https://github.com/liflab/beepbeep-3-palettes) and
  their dependencies
- Optionally, an IDE such as Eclipse or NetBeans to read and run the code
  examples

Organization of this repository
-------------------------------

Detailed information can be found in the extensive
[website](https://liflab.github.io/beepbeep-3-examples) that documents this
repository. In a nutshell:

- All code is in the `Source/src` folder. If you want to look at the examples
  inside an IDE, you can create a Java project with `Source` as the root
  folder.
- Each subfolder corresponds to a Java package. Each package contains examples
  centered on a particular theme. For example, the `http` folder shows how to
  use network connections.
- Read the Javadoc comments in `package-info.java` in each subfolder for a
  description of that particular set of files.
- Read the Javadoc comments in each file for specific details.

Again, unless you want to *run* the examples, it is recommended you browse the
[website](https://liflab.github.io/beepbeep-3-examples) for a more pleasant
experience.

About BeepBeep
--------------

The BeepBeep 3 event stream processor is being developed by all the folks of
[Laboratoire d'informatique formelle](https://liflab.ca) at
[Université du Québec à Chicoutimi](http://www.uqac.ca), Canada.

Generating the Javadoc
----------------------

The documentation for this repository is generated by
[Doxygen](http://doxygen.org). The configuration file `Doxyfile` contains the
appropriate settings for reading the source files and generating HTML in the
`docs` folder. On the command line, you should be able to run:

    $ doxygen Doxyfile

However, these files must be post-processed a little. Run the PHP script
`post-process.php` afterwards. When re-generating the documentation, it may
also be wise to first wipe the contents of the `docs` folder.

It is *not* recommended to use `javadoc` to generate the HTML documentation.
Several features (such as cross-referenced source code) will be missing from
the output.
